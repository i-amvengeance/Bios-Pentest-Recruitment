This file consists of the breakdown of the process in which I reached the flags.  
After reading the challenge description , to find out whch ports were open , I ran the nmap command.  
But,to get more information , I ran the nmap -A command and found out that port 2121(ftp) , port 2222(ssh) , port 8000(http) were open and were vulnerable.  
So , in the nmap -A command , i found out that port 2121 can be accessed through Anonymous login. So I ran the ftp command to connect to the given IP Address and for the user , i typed anonymous.  
Then there came the ftp command line. I did ls -a and i got the fear.txt using get command.  
I exited the port and did cat fear.txt and there was my first flag .  
Then , I went to the browser and opened the http website of port 8000.  
Then , from nmap -A command, i found out that there were three dissalowed entries in robots.txt  
I opened the fl4g.html page and there was a statement . I went on to inspect it and there was y second flag.  
Then, I went to cookie dough .pcapng and downloaded it.  
I installed wireshark to open it .  
There , i extracted all the http files and they were login.php and username.php  
In that , I found out the username justin and password majorockyou for a user on the ssh port 2222 for the given ip address.
